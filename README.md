# fsjs-techdegree-project-2


For this project, I went far beyond the requested tasks.
- I created a function to activate the search feature when the user hits the "Enter" key, not just when the search button is clicked.
- I also created a function to reset the page if the search field is empty when the user hits a key or clicks the search button.

Possible Future Features:
- A <select> node that lets the user choose how many results they'd like to see per page. I've already created variables in the appropriate places for itemsPerPage. The options will probably be 10, 20, 50, and all (listItems.length).
